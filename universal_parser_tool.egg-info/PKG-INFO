Description: # Universal Problem Parser Tool
        
        ## Install
        
        Simple and straight. Make sure you have Python3 and pip. Then install using this command.
        
        `pip install universal-parser-tool`
        
        This script needs selenium to run. The python library will be added by default if you use the above command. 
        The below link has explained how to install selenium drivers.
        Firefox is the default driver for this code, so install Firefox and it's driver as in the link below.

        The main idea is based on [this repository](https://github.com/xalanq/cf-tool).
        So you must add `cf` to your PATH.
        
        After installing, `upt` command will be added to your PATH.
        
        ## Parse
        
        You can use `upt` like this script:
        
        `upt <PARSER> <PARSER COMMANDS>`

        - AtCoder (Added login feature!)
        - Codechef
        - Spoj
